# Background

I originally tried

# Using the AlgorithmXSolver Class

If you use my AlgorithmXSolver, you will need to copy the code into your coding environment. In this playground, I am able to simplify things by using the following import statement.

```python
from AlgorithmX import AlgorithmXSolver
```

__This import statement will not work in your coding environment. You will need to copy all of the following code into your source file.__

```python
#  This solution uses Knuth's Algorithm X and his Dancing Links (DLX):
#  (DLX Based Algorithm X Solver Last Revised 06/02/2024)
#
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X
#
#  June 02, 2024 - history added to allow subclasses to make adaptations for multiplicity.
#                - giving this Solver similar functionality to Knuth's Algorithm M.

```
