# Strategy

Did you create a single SudokuSolver class that was able to solve the 4 Sudoku puzzles? If you did, you might consider starting with that structure and applying it to this puzzle. After all, a Sudoku is a special kind of Latin Square. Keep in mind a Latin Square is _less restrictive_ than a Sudoku, so it feels like a thing or two might need to be _removed_ from your Sudoku solver.

You will also need to handle grids of different sizes in the same puzzle. In all 4 Sudoku puzzles, all test case grids within a puzzle were the same size.
