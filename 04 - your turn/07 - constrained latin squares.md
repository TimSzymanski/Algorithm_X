# Strategy
Did you create a single SudokuSolver class that was able to solve the 4 Sudoku puzzles? If you did, you might consider starting with that structure and applying it to this puzzle. Keep in mind a Latin Square is _less restrictive_ than a Sudoku, so it feels like a thing or two might need to be _removed_.
