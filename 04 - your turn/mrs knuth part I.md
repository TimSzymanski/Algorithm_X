Here's a little pseudocode to help you through finishing up Mrs. Knuth Part I:

```text
copy all the AlgorithmX code

define MrsKnuthPartISolver as a subclass of AlgorithmXSolver
    override the constructor to build your requirements and actions from
    the passed in techer_availability and students

read all input
organize input - two main data structures: teacher_availability and students
create an instance of your new Solver class
for each soution in solver.solve()
    for each action in solution
        add the student/instrument to schedule

print the schedule
```

Now that Mrs. Knuth is ready to teach all summer long, let's look at a few other puzzles you are already fully prepared to solve!
