# Critical Skill

All exact cover problems can be visualized as placing tiles or game pieces on a grid or board to build a solution. For Mrs. Knuth, we have a blank weekly calendar 

For that solution to be proper, all constraints must be obeyed and all requirements must be satisfied.

I call the process of “placing a tile/piece on the grid/board” an action. These actions are the steps that can be taken to build a solution. It is important that an exhaustive list of all possible actions be created and given to Algorithm X so that Algorithm X can find all valid solutions.

Visualizing the grid/board and the tiles/pieces is often a powerful first step when trying to tackle an exact cover problem and build a model for Algorithm X. For many of the puzzles covered later, I will go over how I visualize the problem. This is not a completely objective process, so you might come up with ways that work better for you. Even if we visualize a problem slightly differently, we both still need to come up with an exhaustive list of actions to feed into Algorithm X.

You might not believe this, but I have a great puzzle to help you practice coming up with an exhaustive list of actions!
