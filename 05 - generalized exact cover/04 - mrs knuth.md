# She's Back!

How about the good news first? None of the input, nor the output, has changed for Mrs. Knuth – Part II. Let’s see what she changes she needs made…

_Mrs. Knuth's schedule needs to be more flexible than she first thought. She isn't able to always teach the same number of hours on her teaching days. She also doesn't always have enough students to completely fill her `teacherAvailability`. You'll need to adjust your algorithm to handle her `teacherAvailability` possibly containing different numbers of hours for each day she teaches and you'll need to be able to handle hours in her `teacherAvailability` for which there ends up being no student scheduled._

_You might be impressed with Mrs. Knuth's newfound flexibility, but don't get too relaxed. She still requires that no instrument be taught more than one hour on any one day. On top of that, she has struggled with `loudInstrument`s, specifically the __Trumpet__, the __Drums__ and the __Trombone__. In the interest of her long-term hearing, she has asked that you make sure no two `loudInstrument`s are ever scheduled back-to-back. (A lesson at 11am and a lesson at 1pm are not considered back-to-back since there is an hour lunch break between the two.)

For the most part, the kids in school are good kids, but some kids get a bit rowdy when they are with certain friends. To avoid disruptions to her schedule, Mrs. Knuth has given you a list of `troublesomePair`s. It's important the individuals in these pairs never be scheduled back-to-back. There must be at least an hour of time between the two individuals to ensure they don't get each other wound up and start causing trouble.

Despite Mrs. Knuth's wacky requests, all students must get a spot on her schedule.
