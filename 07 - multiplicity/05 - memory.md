# Making Algorithm X Smarter About Duplicates




# How Important is This?

What if Ella wanted 3 lesons? What if each of the students wanted 2 lessons? The more multplicity in the problem, the more crazy things can get. In Mrs. Knuth - Part III, all valid solutions need to be found and scored to determine the best schedule for Mrs. Knuth. The following table shows you how many distinct solutions need to be scored for each test case and how many solutions are generate by Algorithm X if multiplicity is _not_ properly handled.
