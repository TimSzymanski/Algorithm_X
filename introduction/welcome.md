# Welcome!

A quick Google search will surely bring you to countless implementations of Algorithm X, usually solving a 9x9 Sudoku grid using the famous Dancing Links (DLX) technique proposed by the brilliant Donald Knuth. This playground is NOT just another Sudoku demonstration. Rather, the goal here is to go deeper and explore using Algorithm X to teach both reusable problem solving techniques and reusable software architectures. By the time you're finished working your way through the material, you should feel confident solving any exact cover problem you run across!
