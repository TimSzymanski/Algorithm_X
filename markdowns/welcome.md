# Welcome!

A quick Google search will surely bring you to countless implementations of Algorithm X, usually solving a 9x9 Sudoku grid using the famous Dancing Links (DLX) technique proposed by the brillian Donald Knuth. This playground is NOT just another Sudoku demonstration. Rather, the goal here is to go deeper and explore using Algorithm X to teach both reusable problem solving techniques and reusable software architectures. By the time you are finished working your way through the material, you should feel confident solving any exact cover problem you run across!


This Python template lets you get started quickly with a simple working example. If it is your first contribution then you should have a look at the [Getting Started](https://tech.io/doc/getting-started-create-playground) document.


The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template), please feel free to come up with proposals to improve it.

# Hands-on Demo

# Template Resources

[`markdowns/welcome.md`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/blob/master/markdowns/welcome.md)
What you are reading here is generated by this file. Tech.io uses the [Markdown syntax](https://tech.io/doc/reference-markdowns) to render text, media and to inject programming exercises.


[`python-project`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/tree/master/python-project)
A simple Python project dedicated to run the programming exercise above. A project relies on a Docker image to run. You can find images on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/explore/) or you can even [build your own](https://tech.io/doc/reference-runner).


[`techio.yml`](https://github.com/TechDotIO/python-template/blob/master/techio.yml)
This *mandatory* file describes both the table of content and the programming project(s). The file path should not be changed.


# Visual and Interactive Content

Tech.io provides all the tools to embed visual and interactive content like a Web app or a Unix terminal within your contribution. Please refer to the [documentation](https://tech.io/doc) to learn more about the viewer integrations.
