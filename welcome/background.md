In August, 2022, I attempted to solve [Constrained Latin Squares]( https://www.codingame.com/training/medium/constrained-latin-squares), a recently published puzzle by [@darkhorse64]( https://www.codingame.com/profile/c9ebe76a83b33730956eda0534d6cad86053292) on [Codingame](www.codingame.com). I noticed [@5DN1L]( https://www.codingame.com/profile/bbb8f47ea4601179303c20acdbf5fb6c1904782) had, a week earlier, posted a link to [Puzzles solvable by Algorithm X / Dancing Links](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/puzzles-solvable-by-algorithm-x-dancing-links/196871), a post where he had compiled a list of puzzles on [Codingame](www.codingame.com) he had solved with [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X). I love processes that are repeatable and the idea of using a single algorithm to solve a long list of medium/hard puzzles intrigued me.

For the next 18 months, I worked on [@5DN1L]( https://www.codingame.com/profile/bbb8f47ea4601179303c20acdbf5fb6c1904782)’s list, reaching out to him over and over again with questions and ideas. I saw tremendous opportunity for not only a reusable software architecture, but also a repeatable engineering process for solving [Exact Cover]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exact_cover) problems. Eventually, he suggested I build an [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) playground, and here we are!

I can’t thank [@5DN1L]( https://www.codingame.com/profile/bbb8f47ea4601179303c20acdbf5fb6c1904782) enough for all of his guidance, support, ideas, encouragement, questions, answers, poking, prodding, reviewing, etc. This playground is his creation every bit as much as it is mine. His influence has made a permanent mark on who I am and how I approach problems. I am forever grateful.
