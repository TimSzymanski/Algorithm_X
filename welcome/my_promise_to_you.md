__My Promise to You__

I wholeheartedly believe that working through this playground and the accompanying puzzles will be a great experience on multiple levels. How can I say this? All these things happened for me as I studied [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) and applied it to as many puzzles as possible. I promise…

* You will become proficient with a powerful and repeatable problem solving technique known as [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X).
* You will experience the compelling nature of reusable software architectures.
* You will find every puzzle listed above significantly easier than it would have been otherwise. I’m not saying they’ll all be easy, but they will indeed be easier.
* You will have a lot of fun.
* You will earn up to 1700 [Codingame](www.codingame.com) XP!
