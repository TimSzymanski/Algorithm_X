[Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) is a promise. If you can build a proper model to a particular problem space, [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) promises to find all solutions to that problem space. Papers have been written and projects have been done to demonstrate “how” [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) works. That is not the goal here. Instead, the focus of this exercise is to build expertise in the realm of modeling. The goal is to build models that [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) easily digests and returns solutions. Only a cursory understanding of [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) is required, and the implementation details will barely be covered. Instead, you will be asked to build models of problems and you will have the opportunity to see how well you modeled each problem simply by seeing how easily [Algorithm X]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth%27s_Algorithm_X) converted your models into solutions.
